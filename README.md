# Invoicer

Invoicer allows you to create invoices on the fly. In order to construct an invoice you first need to create some products or services that you sell. Next you can construct an invoice and once you are finished you can send it to your customer or employer with a generated email. Another feature of Invoicer is the ability to view or resend previously constructed invoices.
