# Invoicer
Invoicing App
Invoicer allows you to create invoices on the fly. Once an invoice is finished you can send them to your customer or employer. The document will be converted to a pdf document before it is sent to ensure it is easy to use and print. From within the app you can print off a copy for yourself of any invoice you create (via a google cloud printer).
